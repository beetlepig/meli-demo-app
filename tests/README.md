# Testing

Testing was implemented using [playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright), an E2E testing framework, to run the tests, do the following.

1. Install playwright components: `npm run playwright:install`
2. Run the tests: `npm run test`
3. If you want to run the ui mode, run the following: `npm run test -- --ui`
